## FAQ

**Section Title**: Frequently asked questions
**Subtitle**: Everything you need to know about DanceBook

**Questions & Answers**:

1. **How does split payout work?**
   When a student pays for a class, we automatically deduct our platform commission (typically 10%) and send the remaining amount directly to the trainer's account. No manual processing, no delays, no complicated reconciliation.

2. **Do trainers need to have an account?**
   Yes, trainers need to create a free account to receive payouts and manage their classes. The signup process is quick and includes identity verification for security and compliance purposes.

3. **What payment methods are accepted?**
   We support Apple Pay, Google Pay, and all major credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express). All payments are processed securely through our PCI-compliant payment infrastructure.

4. **Is personal data safe?**
   Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption (AES-256) to protect all data. We're PCI DSS compliant and follow strict data protection regulations including GDPR. Your financial information is never stored on our servers.

5. **Can I cancel or reschedule a booking?**
   Yes, you can cancel or reschedule bookings according to the trainer's cancellation policy. Refunds are processed automatically for eligible cancellations, typically within 2-3 business days.

6. **How do trainers set their availability?**
   Trainers can sync their existing calendar or use our built-in scheduling system. They can set recurring availability, block out times, and update their schedule in real-time. Students only see available slots.

7. **What happens if a trainer doesn't show up?**
   If a trainer fails to show up without proper notice, students receive an automatic full refund. We also have a dispute resolution system and maintain trainer performance metrics to ensure quality service.

8. **Are there any setup fees for trainers?**
   No setup fees, no monthly fees, no hidden costs. We only charge a small commission on successful bookings. This means trainers can start earning immediately without any upfront investment.
